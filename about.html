hello! my name is umaama. i was born in colombo, sri lanka, before moving to jakarta, indonesia, and living there till i was 7. i then lived in kl, malaysia, and sort of in hydrabad, india, before settling back down in sri lanka, where i lived till i moved to cambridge, ma for college.

i study physics - though i don't really know what i want to do with it, only that i enjoy it very much. something cool i'm working on right now is this model of a biomimetic counter-current heat exchanger that can passively ventilate and thermoregulate an enclosed space. i'm hoping to implement some active mechanisms too, so the internal environment can be dynamically controlled based on the ambient temperature. this is what i will likely base my final project on so read more about it on my final project page! other than research, i also love singing with my acapella group, the fallen angels, planning hoco stuff for cabot, pafing, fipping, and hanging out with my friends :)
